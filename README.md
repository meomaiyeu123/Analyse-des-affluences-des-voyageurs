# Stade de France Affluence Analysis
This project analyzes passenger flow patterns around the Stade de France during events like concerts and sports matches.

## Objective:

- Understand peak arrival times: When do most attendees arrive relative to the event start time?
Analyze departure patterns: How long does it take for attendees to leave the stadium after the event ends?
Benefits:

- Optimized transportation plans: Insights will help improve public transport efficiency by identifying peak arrival and departure times.
Preparation for Paris Olympic Games: This project aids in developing effective crowd management strategies for large-scale events like the Olympics.
